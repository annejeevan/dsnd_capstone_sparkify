# Predict Customer Churn

Determine customer churn for a music streaming company called Sparkify. The users stream their favorite songs either using the free tier that place advertisements between songs or use the premium plan for which they pay a monthly fee with no advertisements between songs. Users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their services. The dataset given to us contains a log of the activities of each user on the service whether they are playing songs, logging out, upgrading their service or cancelling the service. All this data contains key insights in keeping the users of the service happy. Our task in this project is to develop a model that predict which users are at risk. If we can identify users that are at risk to churn either by downgrading from premium or by cancelling their service, the business can offer them incentives and discounts potentially saving millions in revenues or maximize revenues.
